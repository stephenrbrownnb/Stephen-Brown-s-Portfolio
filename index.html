 A little bit about me, So my name is Stephen Brown and i'm from Sussex New Brunswick. I spend most of my time in the summer on Grand lake in Jemseg New Brunswick and I have a passion for building. 
 There is just something about seeing something that i've built that I find incredibly rewarding be it code or woodworking. I have a cabin on the lake which I restored after it was destroyed
 in the flood of 2018 and a nearly 3 year old charcoal lab named Bella who loves it at the lake even more than I do.  I spent 11 years in Calgary Alberta doing physical Security with a focus 
 on systems, meaning I was considered an expert on Card Access CCTV, intercoms, radios, ect.  However my heart and my family have always been in New Brunswick so I gave that up and moved back home. 
 Currently I am working at Poley Mountain Ski Resort but am seeking a change to the Web Development field so that I can have an exciting career in the place I call home.
